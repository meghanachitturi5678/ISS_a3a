-  Then you have enter each student's data in this way(format and words Name,Roll-Number,Maths,CSE,Science):
      Name:Student
      Roll-Number:2021
      Maths:1,CSE:2,Science:3
- Then Roll-Number and Name of all students gets printed and it asks to type the Roll-Number of student whose information is required
- Then required information of corresponding student gets printed
_Here,rank is calculated based on the priorities(high to low:Sum of marks,Maths marks,CSE marks, Science marks,Roll-Number(decreasing)_

**Question3**

- Then it asks for your choice(ascending/descending)
-  If you type ascending,then 10 strings gets printed in ascending order and then it asks for one more string,then  these 11 strings in ascending order
